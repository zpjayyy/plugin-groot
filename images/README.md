# Plugin Branding and Images

To maintain a consistent and professional appearance across the ElizaOS ecosystem, we recommend including the following assets in your plugin repository:

1. **Required Images:**
   - `logo.png` (400x400px) - Your plugin's square logo
   - `banner.png` (1280x640px) - A banner image for your plugin

2. **Image Location:**

   ```
   plugin-name/
   ├── images/
   │   ├── logo.png
   │   ├── banner.png
   ```

3. **Image Guidelines:**
   - Use clear, high-resolution images
   - Keep file sizes optimized (< 500KB for logos, < 1MB for banners)
   - [Image example](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/client-twitter/blob/main/images/banner.jpg)
   - Include alt text for accessibility
